# The Parable of the Pipeline
by [[Burke Hedges]]

## Highlights and Notes

> The large majority of millionaires are not the descendants of the Rockefellers or Vanderbilts. More than 80 % are ordinary people who have accumulated their wealth in one generation.

> [[Kiyosaki]] tells a brief story about two young men who were hired to deliver water from a lake to their village a mile away. One of the young men used buckets to carry the water. The other young man built a pipeline. Over the long run, the young man who built the pipeline fared far better than the bucket carrier.

> Live for today, plan for tomorrow.
