# Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End

by [[Atul Gawande]]

## Highlights and Notes

> Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.

> The veneration of elders may be gone, but not because it has been replaced by veneration of youth. Itâ€™s been replaced by veneration of the Independent self.

> Leonid Gavrilov, a researcher at the University of Chicago, argues that human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually.
