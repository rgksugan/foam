# The Little Book That Still Beats the Market
by [[Joel Greenblatt]]

## Highlights
> The formula starts with a list of the largest 3,500 companies available for trading on one of the major U.S. stock exchanges.5 It then assigns a rank to those companies, from 1 to 3,500, based on their return on capital.

> Next, the formula follows the same procedure, but this time, the ranking is done using earnings yield. The company with the highest earnings yield is assigned a rank of 1, and the company with the lowest earnings yield receives a rank of 3,500.

> First, since the returns reported in this book were based on holding a portfolio of roughly 30 stocks selected by the magic formula, we should make sure that our plan includes holding at least 20 to 30 stocks at one time. Remember, the magic formula works on average, so holding many stocks that are ranked highly by the magic formula should help keep us close to that average over time.

> Second, in our tests, each stock was held for a period of one year. Holding stocks for one year is still fine for tax-free accounts. For taxable accounts, we will want to adjust that slightly. For individual stocks in which we are showing a loss from our initial purchase price, we will want to sell a few days before our one-year holding period is up. For those stocks with a gain, we will want to sell a day or two after the one-year period is up. In that way, all of our gains will receive the advantages of the lower tax rate afforded to long-term capital gains (a lower tax rate under federal guidelines for stocks held more than one year), and all of our losses will receive short-term tax treatment (a deduction against other sources of income that otherwise could have been taxable at rates up to 35 or 40 percent). Over time, this minor adjustment can add significantly to our after-tax investment returns.

> Remember, you must be committed to continuing this process for a minimum of three to five years, regardless of results.

> Use return on assets (ROA) as a screening criterion. Set the minimum ROA at 25%. (This will take the place of return on capital from the magic formula study.)

> From the resulting group of high ROA stocks, screen for those stocks with the lowest price/earning (P/E) ratios. (This will take the place of earnings yield from the magic formula study.)

> Eliminate all utilities and financial stocks (i.e., mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies) from the list.

> If a stock has a very low P/E ratio, say 5 or less, that may indicate that the previous year or the data being used are unusual in some way. You may want to eliminate these stocks from your list. You may also want to eliminate any company that has announced earnings in the last week. (This should help minimize the incidence of incorrect or untimely data.)
