# Just Keep Buying: Proven Ways to Save Money and Build Your Wealth
by [[Nick Maggiulli]]

## Highlights
> Formally this approach is known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA), or the regular purchase of an asset over time.

> For example, researchers at the London School of Economics released a paper titled, “Why Do People Stay Poor?” that illustrated how the lack of initial wealth (and not motivation or talent) is what keeps people in poverty.

> The most consistent way to get rich is to grow your income and invest in income-producing assets.
