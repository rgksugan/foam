# Choose FI: Your Blueprint to Financial Independence
by [[Chris Mamula]] [[Brad Barrett]] [[Jonathan Mendonsa]]

## Highlights

> FI is all about the amount of money you need relative to the cost of the lifestyle you desire.

> A simple way to save #money on insurance is to keep your insurance separate from your investments.

> [[Geoarbitrage]] is the act of exploiting differences in the cost of living between two locations. This allows you to leverage this difference by earning money in one area, then spend it in another community where those dollars go further.

> You should question the assumption that college is right for everyone. If you want to be a doctor or medical professional, lawyer, engineer, or accountant, that answer is clearly yes. For others, like those looking to be entrepreneurs, computer coders, trade workers, or pursuing a career in the arts, the answer is far less clear.

> College is an #investment. Rather than viewing college as a good decision at any price, look at the cost—both money and time—of obtaining a degree and the expected return from having that degree.

> One upside of owning real estate is that housing prices and rents tend to match or outpace the rate of inflation (i.e., an ongoing increase in prices).
