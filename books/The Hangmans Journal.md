# The Hangmans Journal
by [Shashi Warrier](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1042465.Shashi_Warrier)

## Highlights
> Only the poorest buy their oil and spices daily. Everyone else buys larger quantities.

> From the time you are born you begin to build up a sort of account of little obligations and favours and gifts, all of which have to be paid back.

> Janardhanan, when you pursue something single-mindedly, you stand to lose a lot. If you want to be really good at anything, you have to be willing to lose something. I don’t know if I’m any good at what I do, but it has cost me peace in my later life, as you can see. But it has still been worthwhile. All these other things, they are only pinpricks. Just do what you have to do.

> [[Power]] meant the capacity to inflict pain.
