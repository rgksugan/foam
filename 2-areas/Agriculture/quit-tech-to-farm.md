# Quitting tech to Farm

I don't think you can 'quit' tech to farm, you can only retire from tech to farm.

The quantum of investment it takes to be an economically viable farmer is simply out of reach to anyone without *substantial* savings.

Farming is a difficult, thankless, low return business except in very narrow verticals - and those need massive capex.

Unless one is inheriting a massive amount of agri land, starting a farming business in a bull market is much much harder than starting a tech business in the depths of a recession.
