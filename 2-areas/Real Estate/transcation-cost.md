# Transaction cost

Given the transaction costs, itâ€™s probably better to wait to buy something a little outside of your budget than to buy a starter home and then sell it within a few years.

Transaction costs include brokerage, taxes (capital gains tax), stamp duty, registration charges and Goods and Services Tax (GST) in case of under construction property.
