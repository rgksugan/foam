## The History of Digital Advertising Technology
* The year 1994 saw the first recorded example of online display advertising in the form of a banner ad, which appeared on a website called HotWired (now wired.com). It was purchased by telecommunications giant AT&T and used to promote its campaign titled You Will.
* Over its three-month life span, 44% of viewers clicked on the banner ad; compare that to today, where it’s estimated that online visitors click on about 0.02% to 2% of ads.

### Insertion order
* **Campaign objectives**: Target group, traffic, branding, etc.
* **Line items with campaign execution terms**: Which banner sizes to use, where to place the ads, and which pages to display the ads on.
* **Business terms**: The pricing model (CPM, CPC, etc.) and payment terms.

### Ad server
* Initially were used to control the delivery and management of online ads.
* Targetting was simple based on HTTP headers
  * The language set on the user’s computer
  * The URL of the page the ad is being loaded onto
  * The browser type and version
  * The user’s operating system
* Advertisers had to sign individual insertion orders with every publisher they wanted to work with and coordinate the campaign execution.

## Glossary
* **CTR - Click-through rate** (is the number of clicks an ad receives divided by the number of times it’s displayed. For example, if an ad had a CTR of 2%, then for every 1,000 impressions, it received 20 clicks.)
* **CPM - Cost per Mile** (Thousand impressions, mile is thousand in latin)
* **CPC - Cost per Click**
