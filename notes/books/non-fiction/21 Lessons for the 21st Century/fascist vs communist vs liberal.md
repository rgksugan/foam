The [[fascist]] [[story]] explained [[history]] as a struggle among different nations, and envisioned a [[world]] dominated by one human group that violently subdues all others. The [[communist]] story explained history as a struggle among different classes, and envisioned a world in which all groups are united by a centralised social system that ensures [[equality]] even at the price of [[freedom]]. The [[liberal]] story explained history as a struggle between liberty and tyranny, and envisioned a world in which all humans cooperate freely and peacefully, with minimum central control even at the price of some inequality.
