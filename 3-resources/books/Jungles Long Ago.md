# Jungles Long Ago
by [[Kenneth Anderson]]

## Highlights
> It is the solitary elephant one has to be careful of.

> Carnivora have a very poor sense of smell, so it hardly mattered as far as they were concerned, but deer and elephant would know we were coming long in advance of our arrival.

> In a jungle, the closer one can get to the ground, the better one can hear.

> Snakes have no ears, but they make up for lack of hearing by an acute sense of feeling. Through the scale upon their bellies that rest against the ground they are able to sense danger from anything that moves by detecting the vibration caused by that movement.

> Snakes' eyes are lidless and fixed, and cannot turn sideways or backwards.

> Catching a cobra is really very easy once you rivet its attention. It is only when the reptile is in rapid motion that the operation becomes difficult and entails considerable risk.
