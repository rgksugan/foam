# The Toilet Seat
by [[Latha]]

## Highlights
> If sex isn’t an important part of your marriage, you can’t beef if your wife or husband does this unimportant thing with somebody else every once in a while, if you have no interest in it.

> If you don’t laugh during sex at least once, you are having sex with the wrong person.

> It takes more than sex to build a great marriage, but is it nearly impossible to build a great marriage without it!

> Love is expressed more through touch rather than the words we speak. When this need is not taken care of properly, there is every chance that the love may start diminishing.

> People do not seem to understand the difference between talking about sex and sexy talk.

> How many people are able to make the other person feel loved and respected when they share their bodies with each other?

> Masturbation is a much better indulgence than loveless sex.

> The subject of sex has always been an intriguing one for me. I am sure it is so for many of us. Well, it is obvious because anything with a taboo attached to it creates interest in us. Anything that is forbidden and suppressed builds our curiosity and urges us to know more about it and experience more of it. Many people have written on sex. In fact, I have read a few books on the subject. These books either talk about the physical act of sex or they deal with sex in a physiological, philosophical or psychological manner. I would encourage you to first read the books of the latter kind, as it is not possible to enjoy lasting pleasure without understanding the depth of the emotions connected with sex.

> Many marriages are ruined on day one itself because of ignorance, though the partners carry on living together just for the sake of society, because they think that is how marriage is supposed to be and everyone must be going through the same problem.

> How many schools, colleges or even homes for that matter impart the lessons of life to their children? How many elders have asked the so-called ‘eligible’ bachelor if he is indeed eligible for marriage? Eligibility in our society only means the money a man brings into the family. When it comes to a woman, even that is not mandatory.

> How many men and women are clear about the responsibilities they have to take up when they take in another life into their lives? Do we ever teach youngsters how to nurture the newly found relationship in their lives? The answer is a big NO! Have any of us advised youngsters to read a good book on sex before getting married? Do we gift couples an educative book on sex so that they become responsible husbands and wives? When one of the underlying reasons for marriage is safe sex, why are we so hesitant to talk and learn about it? Why do we not think sex requires proper education and learning?

> Also, love is expressed more through touch rather than the words we speak. When this need is not taken care of properly, there is every chance that the love may start diminishing.

> How many people even realise that when there is a deep union of two minds, even a tight hug or a brushing kiss can be sexually more satisfying than intercourse itself? If two minds are not in union, nothing can give any pleasure to anyone.

## The Book in 3 Sentences
Talks about sex in the Indian context. At times abuses Indian men for silly reasons. I was not able to agree to all the points the author make. But still it is a worthy read. It would have been a better book if it was co-authored by a male too.

## Who Should Read It?
Every Indian
