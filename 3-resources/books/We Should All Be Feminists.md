# We Should All Be Feminists
by [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]]

## Highlights
> If we do something over and over again, it becomes normal. If we see the same thing over and over again, it becomes normal. If only boys are made class monitor, then at some point we will all think, even if unconsciously, that the class monitor has to be a boy. If we keep seeing only men as heads of corporations, it starts to seem ‘natural’ that only men should be heads of corporations.

> We teach boys to be afraid of fear, of weakness, of vulnerability. We teach them to mask their true selves, because they have to be, in Nigerian-speak, a hard man.

> We say to girls, ‘You can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful but not too successful, otherwise you will threaten the man.

> Poor men still have the privileges of being men, even if they do not have the privileges of being wealthy.

## My Top 3 Quotes
> I often make the mistake of thinking that something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone else.

> Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.

> The language of marriage is often a language of ownership, not a language of partnership.
