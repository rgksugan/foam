# The Phoenix Project
by [[Gene Kim]], [[Kevin Behr]] and [[George Spafford]]

## Highlights
> Perfection is the enemy of good.

> Your job as VP of IT Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service.

> Any improvement made after the bottleneck is useless, because it will always remain starved, waiting for work from the bottleneck. And any improvements made before the bottleneck merely results in more inventory piling up at the bottleneck. [[theory-of-constraints]]
