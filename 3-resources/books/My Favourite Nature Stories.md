# My Favourite Nature Stories
by [[Ruskin Bond]]

## Highlights
> We must cherish each day as though it is our last.

> I was thirty-five—still young enough to take a few risks. If the dream was to become reality, this was the time to do something about it.

> Once you have lived with mountains, there is no escape. You belong to them.

> A lone tree on a wide, flat plain—even if it is a thin, crooked, nondescript tree—gains beauty and nobility from its isolation, from the precarious nature of its existence.

> Such moments come to each of us—moments when we feel deeply moved or inspired, moments when time seems to stand still… They come but rarely, as small miracles, like the fragrance of the first summer ram on parched earth, or the song of the whistling-thrush emerging like a sweet secret from a dark forest; moments when heaven is here, compensating for the irritations and petty disasters that we create around ourselves each day.

> Men come and go, the mountains remain.

> For every time I see the sky I am aware of belonging to the universe rather than to just one corner of the earth.

> The road is never dull, but, given a choice, I’d opt for the sky. The sky is never the same. Even when it’s cloudless, the sky colours are different. The morning sky, the daytime sky, the evening sky, the moonlit sky, the starry sky, there are all different skies.

> I never cease to wonder at the tenacity of water—its ability to make its way through various strata of rock, zigzagging, back tracking, finding space, cunningly discovering faults and fissures in the mountain, and sometimes travelling underground for great distance before emerging into the open. Of course, there’s no stopping water. For no matter how tiny that little trickle, it has to go somewhere!

> Odd, how some little incident, some snatch of conversation comes back to one again and again in the most unlikely places.
