# Jungle Tales for Children
by [[Kenneth Anderson]]

## Highlights
> At school we were enchanted by Grimms’ Fairy Tales by the Brothers Grimm, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling. We then graduated to The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter, The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis and Winnie-the-Pooh by A. A. Milne.

> Mahatma Gandhi bravely told the truth: ‘A nation is judged by the way she treats her animals.’

## Who Should Read It?
I would suggest to anyone interested in knowing the wildlife and in particular to folks in Bengalooru. Also meant for kids to know about the Indian wildlife.
