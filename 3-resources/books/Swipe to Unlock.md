# Swipe to Unlock
by [[Parth Detroja]], [[Aditya Agashe]] and [[Neel Mehta]]

## Highlights
> This debate is summed up in the Silicon Valley proverb: “if you aren’t paying for the product, you are the product.”

> As Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris put it: “all business leaders need to be technologists… and every enterprise needs to become an app company.”

> In other words, robots could take our jobs, and it’d especially hurt the least educated and most vulnerable.

> Economists group technologies into two categories: labor-enabling and labor-replacing. Labor-enabling technologies help workers be more productive. For example, consider PCs and the internet — they’ve made it far easier to write essays, find information, or talk to coworkers. Then there are labor-replacing technologies, like the self-driving cars and industrial robots we mentioned before. As the name implies, labor-replacing technologies can remove the need for human workers. These opposing forces are in a constant tug-of-war.

> Because it’s so hard to remember dark web URLs, and because there is (by definition) no search engine for the dark web, people browsing the dark web start their search at a website called The Hidden Wiki. (Technically, there are many competing websites with this name, and no official one.) The Hidden Wiki contains pages of dark web URLs so people can find the sites they need.

> Through this process, one useful strategy Amazon has found is to undercut their competitors on popular products but actually raise the prices on uncommon products, such as by discounting bestsellers while jacking up prices on obscure books. The idea is that most people will just search for the most common products (which will end up being cheaper on Amazon), so they’ll start to assume that Amazon has the best prices overall. That’ll hook customers on Amazon and get them to pay more for the less-common things they’ll buy down the road.

> In short, the freemium strategy is this: give away the app for free to draw in a massive number of users, find the “power users” who love the app, and charge them — either once or via a recurring subscription — for extra features.

> There are two big reasons app makers are turning to subscriptions. First, they provide a steady and reliable source of income, whereas relying on one-off purchases leads to big spikes in revenue when you release a new update and big crashes at other times. Second, customers who subscribe tend to stick with the app longer (probably because they feel they have a long-term relationship with the app instead of a one-off interaction), meaning they’ll pay the company more money throughout their lives. In business terms, customers will have a higher “lifetime value” (LTV), and maximizing LTV is widely seen as the holy grail for digital businesses.

> There’s one important caveat to keep in mind whenever you’re doing statistical tests: you need to check whether your observed findings happened because of something meaningful or were just due to chance. For instance, if you flip a coin six times and get five heads, you can’t be confident that the coin is unfairly weighted toward heads — it could just be dumb luck. But if you flipped the coin six hundred times and got five hundred heads, you might be on to something.

> When companies perform A/B tests, experimenters report how one version changed a particular metric compared to the other version. They also report a statistic called a p-value, which shows the probability that the difference they observed was due to chance. Usually, if p < 0.05 (i.e. there’s a less than 5% chance that the difference was just random), they can assume the change was meaningful, or “statistically significant.” Otherwise, they can’t be sure that their results weren’t just dumb luck.
