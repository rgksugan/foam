# Building a Second Brain
by [[Tiago Forte]]

## Summary
Human brain has its limitations. For instance, you might remember that you have done this task earlier but not how. These kind of instances can be brought down, if you have notes of this task, and organised it in a way that it is searchable when needed. This group of notes is what the author calls a second brain and this brain explains how to capture and organise these notes.

## Highlights
> The secret to making reading a habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable.

> As knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource.

> The truth is, any system that must be perfect to be reliable is deeply flawed.
