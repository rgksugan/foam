# The Ivory Throne
by [[Manu S. Pillai]]

## Highlights
> Being a member of the royal family was like being a favourite bird in a golden cage. You were watched and humoured and spoilt and loved. It was only when you were alone with yourself that you remembered the cage.

> Caste was such a ruthless injustice that even Swami Vivekananda was moved to decry, in an uncharacteristic display of indignation, the whole state as ‘a lunatic asylum’.

> English education had become a passport to success by the second half of the nineteenth century.

> From 1817 until 1914, for almost a century, thus, with a single exception, every Dewan of Travancore had been a Brahmin (all of them were charged with nepotism and none of them were Malayalis).

> But as always, moderates were rarely heard and the more extreme clamour for individual partition was set to succeed.

> The history of civilization, is written largely in the history of its ports.

> Any action against the ruler or the principality was now swamidroham, a crime against the almighty.

> But attempting to reverse the course of history was an initiative doomed to fail.

> With an average of eleven titles, 5.8 wives, 12.6 children, 9.2 elephants shot, 2.8 private railway cars, 3.4 Rolls Royces, and 22.9 tigers killed, the Maharajahs had plenty to keep them merry while their people toiled through the business of everyday survival.

> Rama Varma had a simple meal of his own. ‘He only ever ate toast, roasted vegetables and something they called karipatti, which was made from jaggery of the palmyra tree.’
