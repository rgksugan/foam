# The Secret World of Sleep
by [[Dr Guy Leschziner]]

## Highlights
> As we pass through life, our sleep changes, both in quantity and in quality.

> A newborn will sleep for two-thirds of the day, but by the time we are adults, we tend to sleep between roughly six and a half and eight and a half hours a night.

> As newborns, we spend about half of our sleep in REM sleep, while in adults this ranges from 15–25 per cent, gradually falling as we approach old age.

> Moreover, it appears that shift work is also associated with gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

> The theory suggests that by predicting sunlight, and knowing when oxygen levels are going to rise, organisms can protect themselves from toxic damage, by generating these proteins at an appropriate time of day.

> We are all children of the sun. We are enthralled by it, and enslaved by it; we march to the beat of the sun’s drum. Our sleep patterns are defined by the 24-hour rhythm of the rotation of the earth and our exposure to the sun’s light. This makes total sense: to be awake and foraging for food when it is light and we can see prey and predators, and to sleep when it is dark and we are vulnerable to predation, seems crucial to our survival.

> The melatonin acts as a chemical signal to the rest of the brain that it is time to sleep, acting on melatonin receptors distributed very widely, not only in the brain, but also in multiple other tissues like the kidneys, gut, heart, lungs, skin and reproductive organs. So, by studying the rise and fall in melatonin levels in the blood, we can monitor someone’s circadian rhythm, and the length of their cycle.

> Daytime stress may cause night-time sleep to be less deep.

> Alcohol is generally considered a sedative, but actually may have precisely the reverse effect. It makes sleep more fragmented, and a full bladder can certainly wake people up – as can the snoring associated with a skinful of beer.

> I have suggested melatonin, a tablet version of the hormone produced by the brain as a signal to sleep – what we term a sleep promoter.

> Most traumatising, for parents rather than the children, are sleep terrors, when children will scream and cry inconsolably in the middle of the night and then go back to sleep, subsequently waking without any recollection. These conditions are termed non-REM parasomnias, as they arise from non-dreaming, very deep sleep. Trying to wake a child from deep sleep is highly likely to generate some sleep-talking or even sleepwalking.

> We have known for years that certain animals like dolphins, seals and birds can sleep with one half of their brain at a time, allowing them to swim or fly while sleeping, what is termed ‘uni-hemispheric sleep’. Aquatic mammals obviously need to be able to swim and surface to breathe, but like us they must also sleep, so this neat evolutionary trick prevents them from drowning while carrying out these necessary functions. It also stresses the importance of deep sleep from an evolutionary perspective: if deep sleep served little useful purpose, why would this uni-hemispheric sleep be necessary?

> Deep sleep and full wakefulness lie at the extremes of a spectrum, and, implausible as it may sound, it is possible for us to be in both states at the same time.

> Essentially, what they found was that small areas of the brain were awake, while other areas of the brain remained asleep.

> So it seems that sleep, rather than being a global phenomenon affecting the whole brain, is a local occurrence. The brain does not act as a whole, and in these unusual cases, different parts of the brain can simultaneously exist in different states of wakefulness or sleep. In a similar way to a dolphin sleeping with only one hemisphere, it appears that this can happen in the human brain, albeit on a more local level.

> The human brain has the ability, at least in some people, to be awake and asleep at the same time, with different areas of the brain in different states simultaneously.

> The first is that people with a genetic predisposition to sleepwalking might be partially woken by events that for a non-sleepwalker would have little bearing on their sleep. Their deep sleep may be inherently less deep or less stable. I have certainly seen patients in whom sleepwalking has been triggered by noises like a squeaking bed, a plane flying overhead or the rumble of a distant lorry. Perhaps a vibrating phone on the bedside cabinet when a text comes through in the middle of the night.

> The second possibility is almost the opposite explanation – that sleepwalkers sleep more soundly than non-sleepwalkers, and what would normally wake people up completely from deep sleep only succeeds in partially waking the brain of sleepwalkers, resulting in these events. Sleep deprivation is a potent way of making deep sleep even deeper, and some drugs commonly used as sleeping aids can certainly trigger sleepwalking events, sometimes even in people who have never sleepwalked.

## Contents
### Circadian Rhythms
* Body clock or something similar to that which dictates for a person when to sleep and when to be awake. It differs per person and is influenced by Sun/light, environment etc.
* https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx

### Uni-hemispheric sleep
* Where half of the brain sleeps and the other is active.
  * Like in dolphins, so that they can still swim and float
