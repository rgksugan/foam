# Goat Days
by [[Benyamin]]

## Highlights
> I don’t know how many emotions were solidified in that cry—sorrow, fear, hurt, pain. It was only then I learned that so many emotions could coalesce into a single cry. One of life’s raw moments that no artist in the world can capture.

> Like all Gulf Malayalis who leave the homeland, we also promised our friends we would arrange visas for them as soon as we landed there and met our Arab.

> The only thing it overtook was the dark smoke its exhaust pipe breathed out.

> I was chained to that place by that very thought.

> Indeed, if the worth of a discovery is measured by its necessity and the demands of one’s situation, to me, my discovery was greater than any other.

> It was only after some time that I realized that activities such as milking come naturally to an animal lover and animals instinctively distinguish them from their mimics.

> We shouldn’t dream about the unfamiliar and about what only looks good from afar. When such dreams become reality, they are often impossible to come to terms with.

> Often it is like that; we justify our desires as the call of Allah.

> Necessity bestows a man with courage he did not know he possessed.

> One of the greatest sorrows in the world is to not have someone to share a beautiful sight.
