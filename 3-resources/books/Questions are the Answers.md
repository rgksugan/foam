# Jungles Long Ago
by [[Allan Pease]]

## Highlights
> Success is a game—the more times you play the more times you win. And the more times you win the more successfully you'll play.

> The Law of Averages governs the success of every activity in life. It means that if you do the same thing the same way over and over again, under the same circumstances, it will produce a set of results that will always remain constant.

> Big time success in Networking is not about convincing people—it's about being organised and disciplined to see as many people as you can—and as soon as possible.
