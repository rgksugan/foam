# The Great Cholesterol Myth
by [[Jonny Bowden]]

## Highlights
> Insulin resistance is something that nearly always precedes type 2 diabetes, and, as we will argue, is an early warning sign of heart disease.

> Understanding insulin resistance—and how to prevent, treat, and even reverse it—is one of the most important things you can do if you want to prevent heart disease.

> Problematic blood measurements, such as high blood sugar, are actually markers of dysfunction that show up fairly late in the game. By the time these traditional red flags show up on your annual blood test, you could already be well on the road to pre-diabetes. And remember, pre-diabetes is diabetes; it’s just not official yet. And diabetes is pre-heart disease. You cannot ignore the early warning signs of diabetes, and unfortunately, most doctors only look for the ones that show up after the damage has already started.

> Fully one-third of those with full-blown diabetes don’t know they have it, and the vast majority of those with early signs of diabetes are utterly clueless about their condition and the disaster that may await them further down the path.

> The good news: Insulin resistance itself can be detected many years before an official diagnosis of diabetes or heart disease, which means you can interrupt the path of heart disease for a double-digit percentage of the population.

> If this book has one single, actionable takeaway, it’s this: Get tested for insulin resistance. It can reveal problems years, or even decades, before you get a diagnosis of either diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

> The best news is that you can stop insulin resistance—and most often reverse it—with diet. Really. You won’t need a single pharmaceutical drug to reverse insulin resistance if you get it early enough and make the right dietary changes. And if you do identify insulin resistance early, you can probably prevent it from morphing into a heart attack down the road.

> If you are one of the millions of people who got a clean bill of health because of low LDL, but your total particle number was actually very high, you are at great risk and are going untreated. (This was exactly the case with Jonny.) Similarly, if you’re one of the millions of people on a statin because of high LDL but your total particle number is actually very low, you’re probably on a medication you don’t need and putting up with side effects that you don’t have to endure.

> The real causes of heart disease: inflammation, oxidation, sugar, and stress.

> Many of the general dietary guidelines accepted and promoted by the government and by major health organizations such as the American Heart Association are either directly or indirectly related to cholesterol phobia. These standard guidelines warn us to limit the amount of cholesterol we eat, despite the fact that for at least 95 percent of the population, cholesterol in the diet has virtually no effect on cholesterol in the blood.

> When it comes to gaining and losing weight, it’s hormones—even more than calories—that control the show.

> Zone diet books have sold millions, had a novel approach that can be summed up in four words: eat fat, lose weight.

> She did some of the early research on trans fats and fervently believed that it is trans fats, not saturated fats, that are the real villains in the American diet; I wholeheartedly agree.

> In those days we pushed patients to undergo angiograms (invasive arterial catheterization imaging) if they had sufficient symptoms of chest pain, borderline exercise tests, and especially cholesterol readings of greater than 280 mg/dL.

> Memory loss is one potential side effect of cholesterol-lowering drugs.

> Cholesterol plays a big role in helping fight bacteria and infections.

> Statin drugs are anti-inflammatory, and their power to reduce inflammation is much more important than their ability to lower cholesterol.

> 1. Don’t smoke. 2. Drink alcohol in moderation. 3. Engage in moderate-to-vigorous exercise for at least half an hour a day on average. 4. Maintain a healthy weight (BMI under 25). 5. Eat a wholesome, low-glycemic (low-sugar) diet with plenty of omega-3 fats and fiber.

> It is very difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.

> Cholesterol levels are a very poor predictor of heart attacks.

> Lowering cholesterol has extremely limited benefits, does not save lives, and should no longer be the focus of our efforts to prevent heart disease.

> Any time you read “partially hydrogenated oil” or “hydrogenated oil” in a list of ingredients, that means the food in question contains trans fats.

> About 80 percent of trans fats in the American diet come from factory-produced partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.

> As exciting as new findings can be, observational studies rarely give us the full story.

> Human beings have a tendency to search for truth in the places where it is easiest to look rather than where it is likely to be found.

> So epidemiology is terrific for observing things, for noticing what’s found together, and, most importantly, for generating hypotheses. Epidemiology is like the preliminary detective work one does when gathering up clues at a crime scene, clues that suggest a hypothesis of what might have gone down. But that’s just the beginning. No one is convicted of a crime based on clues—you use the clues to build a case. In science, that “case” is built with the bricks of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed research studies. The case isn’t built with a few random “clues”—in science, those are the equivalent of circumstantial evidence and would be thrown out of court.

> Cholesterol is the cargo and the lipoprotein is the boat.

> If you’re wondering how to lower your triglycerides, it’s the easiest thing in the world: They drop like a rock on low-carb diets.

> Cholesterol is needed for proper brain functioning.

> The ratio of triglycerides to HDL is one of the best predictors of both heart disease and insulin resistance.

> You want your triglycerides to HDL ratio to be around 2 or less (i.e., 100 triglycerides, 50 HDL). A ratio of 5 (example: 200: 40) increases your risk for cardiovascular events significantly. A ratio of 2 (or less) is wonderful.

> The state-of-the-art test for cholesterol, as of this writing, is the NMR particle test, also known as the NMR Lipo-Profile.

> If there’s a solution to the problem, it has three essential components: One, we need to reduce our exposure to toxins that create arterial wall injury. Two, we need to keep LDL particles away from where they don’t belong. And three, we need to prevent or reduce oxidation and inflammation of those LDL particles and their cholesterol content!

> Cholesterol travels through the blood in a structure known as a “lipoprotein.” The lipoproteins are the boats in the water, while cholesterol is one of the passengers.

> The total number of lipoproteins in the blood stream is far more predictive of heart disease than the amount of cholesterol cargo.

> The triglyceride to HDL ratio is one of the most valuable numbers to know when it comes to predicting heart disease (and diabetes!).

> Yes, fully 80 percent of the cholesterol in your body does in fact come from your own body—the aforementioned liver being the primary source.

## Contents
#### Cholesterol
* Cholesterol is an essential molecule without which there would be no life, so important that virtually every cell in the body is capable of synthesizing it.
* 
* Cholesterol always has to be contained in a protective structure—the protective container that the body uses to safely transport cholesterol is called a lipoprotein (as in “high-density lipoprotein”—HDL—and “low-density lipoprotein”—LDL.) We colloquially call these lipoproteins “cholesterol” but in fact, cholesterol is only a portion of the cargo these lipoprotein “boats” carry around the bloodstream. (For example, lipoproteins also carry triglycerides and protein.)

#### Inflammation
* Acute
* Chronic
