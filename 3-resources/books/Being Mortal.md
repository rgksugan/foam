# Being Mortal
by [[Atul Gawande]]

## Highlights
* Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.

* The veneration of elders may be gone, but not because it has been replaced by veneration of youth. Itâ€™s been replaced by veneration of the Independent self.

* Leonid Gavrilov, a researcher at the University of Chicago, argues that human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually.

## Bibliography
* [[How We Die]] by [[Sherwin Nuland]]
