# Staff Engineer
by [[Will Larson]]

## Highlights
> Work on what matters to make the most of the working hours you have, particularly as you get further along in your career and life’s commitments expand.

> Write an engineering strategy to guide your organization’s approach to supporting your company’s business objectives with its architecture, technology selection, and organizational structure.

> Curate technical quality to maintain the quality of your company’s architecture and software as it grows and tacks over time.

> Stay aligned with authority to remain an effective leader over time. Technical leadership roles rely on proxied authority from another (usually, managerial) leader, and continued access to that authority depends on staying aligned, trustworthy, and predictable.

> Create space for others so that your team grows stronger than your contribution.

> If you’re continuing to advance in your career, then even as your time available for work shrinks, the expectations around your impact will keep growing.

> Companies operate in an eternal iterative elimination tournament, balancing future success against surviving until that future becomes the present.

> As an engineering leadership team, your goal is to maintain an appropriate technical quality level while devoting as much energy as possible towards the core business. You must balance quality across multiple timeframes, and those timeframes generally have conflicting needs.

> It’s also been really valuable for me to cultivate a good personal network of other senior engineers. I chat with them informally about whatever it is that we’re working on and thinking about. When you have personal connections, you can get very unvarnished views of the problems people are seeing and the solutions they’re considering.

> The thing that springs to mind is to find your peers or support network. Just like management, it gets lonely the higher up you go, and it’s important to find peers that will still challenge you, and you can brainstorm ideas with. It doesn’t even matter if they’re in your similar area of work or even are in different companies.

> What’s been most impactful for me is having a lot of people who I think of as mentors, usually friends, former managers, and folks that I’ve worked with. I have a decent number of recurring monthly lunches, coffee chats, and dinners with people who’ve worked with me in the past, know me, and I trust. It’s those conversations about career challenges and growth that have gotten me to where I am in my career.
