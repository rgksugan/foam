by [[Yuval Noah Harari]]

## Highlights
> Priest's real expertise  is story telling, not agriculture or medicine.

> Priests and Gurus have learned only how to make better excuses.

> Religions now divide humanity more than they unify it.

> Religions are very good at making people feel special and chosen. And they use a whole apparatus of rituals and ceremonies to achieve them.
