### Quantifying Greatness
#### Step 1: Define Companies
Given that it is hard to collect data on unlisted companies, my search for great companies will have to stay restricted to listed companies (of which there are approximately 5000 in India). Even within the listed universe, I will limit my search to companies with a minimum market capitalization of Rs 100 crore as the reliability of data on companies smaller than this is somewhat suspect. There are around 1500 listed companies in India with a market cap above Rs 100 crore.
#### Step 2: Define Long Periods
* Accommodate the up and down cycles. (10 years)
#### Step 3: Define Superior Financial Performance
* At the very basic level, a company doing well would mean that it is profitable and it is growing (by successfully reinvesting its profits).
* Thus, my stock-selection filters are companies that deliver revenue growth of 10 per cent and ROCE of 15 per cent every year for the past ten years.
