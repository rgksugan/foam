# The Staff Engineers Path
by [[Tanya Reilly]]

## Highlights
> There’s only one person in the driver’s seat for your career, and that person is you.

> Where do you see yourself in five years? The classic interview question is the adult equivalent of “What do you want to be when you grow up?”

> Becoming a manager is a common, and perhaps default, career step for anyone who can communicate clearly, stay calm during a crisis, and help their colleagues do better work.

> Three pillars of the staff engineer role: big-picture thinking, execution of projects, and leveling up the engineers you work with.

> No matter how deep or arcane your technical knowledge, you’ll find that work gets less annoying when you can persuade other people to adopt your ideas, level up the engineers around you, and breeze through the organizational gridlock that slows everyone down.

> Experienced engineers know that the answer to most technology choices is “it depends.”

> Knowing the pros and cons of a particular technology isn’t enough—you need to know the local details too. What are you trying to do? How much time, money, and patience do you have? What’s your risk tolerance? What does the business need? That’s the context of the decision.

> The *local maximum*, the best decision for a single group, might not be anything like the best decision when you take a broader view.

> To avoid local maxima, teams need decision makers (or at least decision influencers) who can take an outsider view—who can consider the goals of multiple teams at once and choose a path that’s best for the whole organization or the whole business.

> For a small team, a manager can often function as the most experienced technologist, owning major decisions and technical direction.

> But management authority can overshadow technical judgment: reports may feel uncomfortable arguing with a manager’s technical decisions even when there’s a better solution available.

> One way to keep a project moving is to have someone who feels ownership for the whole thing, rather than any of its individual parts.

> TPMs are responsible for delivery, not design, and not engineering quality.

> TPMs make sure the project gets done on time, but staff engineers make sure it’s done with high engineering standards.

> More seasoned engineers can have huge impact by conducting code and design reviews, providing architectural best practices, and creating the kinds of tooling that make everyone faster and safer.

> Staff engineers are role models.

> Managers may be responsible for setting culture on their teams, enforcing good behavior, and ensuring standards are met.

> But engineering norms are set by the behavior of the most respected engineers on the project. No matter what the standards say, if the most senior engineers don’t write tests, you’ll never convince everyone else to do it.

> Senior engineer: the level at which someone can stop advancing and continue their current level of productivity, capability, and output for the rest of their career and still be “regretted attrition” if they leave.
