# Just Keep Buying
by [[Nick Maggiulli]]

## Highlights
> Researchers at the London School of Economics released a paper titled, “Why Do People Stay Poor?” that illustrated how the lack of initial wealth (and not motivation or talent) is what keeps people in poverty.

> The most consistent way to get rich is to grow your income and invest in income-producing assets.

> The end goal should be ownership—using your additional income to acquire more income-producing assets.

> Lifestyle creep is when someone increases their spending after experiencing an increase in income or as a way of keeping up with their peers.

> Once you spend more than 50% of your future raises, then you start delaying your retirement.

> This is why buying a home usually only makes sense for people who will stay in it for the long term. The transaction costs alone can eat away any expected price appreciation if you buy and sell too often.

> In addition to the explicit financial costs associated with maintaining your home, there are also significant time costs as well. I’ve heard far too many anecdotes from friends and family about how being a homeowner is like having a part-time job. Whether you are scheduling repairs or doing it yourself, home maintenance can take up more time than you might initially imagine.

> The primary cost of renting (outside of the monthly rent payment) is long-term risk. This risk shows up in unknown future housing costs, instability in living situation, and ongoing moving costs.

> However, one risk that renters are unlikely to face is whether they will get a good return on their investment.

> The right time to buy a home is when you can meet the following conditions: You plan on being in that location for at least ten years. You have a stable personal and professional life. You can afford it.

> What makes buying a home even easier is if you can afford it. This means being able to provide 20% as a down payment and keeping your debt-to-income ratio below 43%. I chose 43% because that is the maximum debt-to-income ratio you can have for your mortgage to be considered qualified (i.e., lower risk).48 As a reminder, the debt-to-income ratio is defined as: Debt-to-Income Ratio = Monthly Debt / Monthly Income So if you plan to have a $2,000 mortgage and you currently have monthly gross income of $5,000, then your debt-to-income ratio would be 40% ($2,000/$5,000), assuming you have no other debt payments. Of course, if your debt-to-income ratio is lower, then that’s even better.

> Given the transaction costs, it’s probably better to wait to buy something a little outside of your budget than to buy a starter home and then sell it within a few years.

> Given we know that you can spend 4% of your total retirement savings in your first year, then we know that: 4% × Total Savings = Annual Spending Using a fraction instead of a percentage we get: 1/25 × Total Savings = Annual Spending Multiply both sides by 25 to solve for Total Savings, we get: Total Savings = 25 × Annual Spending

> Another way to determine “When can you retire?” is to find the point when your monthly investment income exceeds your monthly expenses.

> Therefore, if you want to save and invest more, be selfish (especially towards your future self). But, your future self isn’t the only reason to invest your money. You should also invest because of the financial forces that are working against you every day.

> This concept helps explain why some professional athletes can make millions of dollars a year and still end up bankrupt. They didn’t convert their human capital to financial capital quickly enough to sustain their lifestyle once they left professional sports. When you make the bulk of your lifetime earnings in four to six years, saving and investing is even more important than it is for the typical worker.

> Despite all the praise that I have just given to stocks, they are not for the faint of heart. In fact, you should expect to see a 50%+ price decline a couple times a century, a 30% decline once every four to five years, and a 10% price decline at least every other year.

> Time is an equity investor’s friend.

> We buy stocks so we can eat well, but we buy bonds so we can sleep well.

> This concept, more formally known as the Lindy Effect, states that something’s popularity in the future is proportional to how long it has been around in the past.

> Ignore the past and you will lose an eye. Live in the past and you will lose both.

> If your net worth exceeds $93,170, which is similar to the median net worth in the U.S., that puts you in the top 10% globally. I don’t know about you, but I would consider someone in the top 10% to be rich.

> Find where you are in your financial journey before deciding where to focus your time and energy. If your expected savings are greater than your expected investment income, focus on savings; otherwise focus on investing. If they are similar, focus on both.

> Cutting spending has its limits, but growing your income doesn’t. Find small ways to grow your income today that can turn into big ways to grow it tomorrow.

> If you ever feel guilty about splurging on yourself, invest the same amount of money into income-producing assets or donate to a good cause. This is the easiest way to have worry-free spending.

> A little lifestyle creep is okay, but keep it below 50% of your future raises if you want to stay on track.

> Before you decide what to retire from, make sure you know what you want to retire to.

> You won’t be able to work forever, so replace your human capital with financial capital before it’s too late.

> To really grow your income, think like an owner and use your money to buy income-producing assets.

> Since most markets are expected to rise over time, buying quickly and selling slowly is the optimal way to maximize your wealth.

> Saving is for the poor and investing is for the rich.

> Your income and spending are rarely fixed, so your savings rate shouldn’t be fixed either. Save what you can to reduce your financial stress.

> These examples illustrate that what you should focus on depends on your financial situation. If you don’t have much money invested, then you should focus on increasing your savings (and investing it). However, if you already have a sizable portfolio, then you should spend more time thinking about the details of your investment plan.

> If your expected savings are higher, then you need to focus more on saving money and adding to your investments. However, if your expected investment growth is higher, then spend more time thinking about how to invest what you already have. If the numbers are close to each other, then you should spend time on both.

> In addition, their estimates show that those in the top 5% of earners saved 37% annually while those in the top 1% saved 51% of their income each year.

> When we have the ability to save more, we should save more—and when we don’t, we should save less. We shouldn’t use static, unchanging rules because our finances are rarely static and unchanging.

> What makes buying a home even easier is if you can afford it. This means being able to provide 20% as a down payment and keeping your debt-to-income ratio below 43%. I chose 43% because that is the maximum debt-to-income ratio you can have for your mortgage to be considered qualified (i.e., lower risk). As a reminder, the debt-to-income ratio is defined as: Debt-to-Income Ratio = Monthly Debt / Monthly Income So if you plan to have a $2,000 mortgage and you currently have monthly gross income of $5,000, then your debt-to-income ratio would be 40% ($2,000/$5,000), assuming you have no other debt payments. Of course, if your debt-to-income ratio is lower, then that’s even better.

> You would need a net worth of $11.1 million to be in the top 1% of U.S. households in 2019. However, after controlling for age and educational attainment, the top 1% varies from as little as $341,000 to as much as $30.5 million.

> In other words, buy quickly, but sell slowly.

> Given we know that you can spend 4% of your total retirement savings in your first year, then we know that: 4% × Total Savings = Annual Spending  Using a fraction instead of a percentage we get: 1/25 × Total Savings = Annual Spending  Multiply both sides by 25 to solve for Total Savings, we get: Total Savings = 25 × Annual Spending.

> We begin our lives as growth stocks and end our lives as value stocks.
