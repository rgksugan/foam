# Sprint
by [[Braden Kowitz]], [[Jake Knapp]] & [[John Zeratsky]]

## Highlights
> The Decider must be involved in the sprint.

> We’ve found the ideal size for a sprint to be seven people or fewer. With eight people, or nine, or more, the sprint moves more slowly, and you’ll have to work harder to keep everyone focused and productive.

> Sprints are most successful with a mix of people: the core people who work on execution along with a few extra experts with specialized knowledge.

> Each map is customer-centric, with a list of key actors on the left. Each map is a story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And, no matter the business, each map is simple. The diagrams are composed of nothing more than words, arrows, and a few boxes.
