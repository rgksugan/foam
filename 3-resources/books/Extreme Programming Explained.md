# Extreme Programming Explained
by [[Kent Beck]]

## Highlights
> It is about getting past our adolescent surety that “I know better than everyone else and all I need is to be left alone to be the greatest.”

> If you can accurately estimate your work, deliver quality the first time, and create rapid feedback loops; then you can be a trustworthy partner.

> Everything in software changes. The requirements change. The design changes. The business changes. The technology changes. The team changes. The team members change. The problem isn’t change, because change is going to happen; the problem, rather, is our inability to cope with change.

> Put improvement to work by not waiting for perfection. Find a starting place, get started, and improve from there.

> To reach excellence, problems need to turn into opportunities for learning and improvement, not just survival.

> Planning is a form of necessary waste. It doesn’t create much value all by itself. Work on gradually reducing the percentage of time you spend planning. Some teams start with a whole day of planning for a week, but gradually refine their planning skills until they spend an hour planning for the week.

> If small, safe steps are how to design, the next question is where in the system to improve the design. The simple heuristic I have found helpful is to eliminate duplication. If I have the same logic in two places, I work with the design to understand how I can have only one copy. Designs without duplication tend to be easy to change. You don’t find yourself in the situation where you have to change the code in several places to add one feature.

> The hum of conversation is a sign of health. Silence is the sound of risk piling up.

> Time and costs are generally set outside the project. That leaves quality as the only variable you can manipulate. Lowering the quality of your work doesn’t eliminate work, it just shifts it later so delays are not clearly your responsibility. You can create the illusion of progress this way, but you pay in reduced satisfaction and damaged relationships. Satisfaction comes from doing quality work.

> Defects destroy the trust required for effective software development. The customers need to be able to trust the software. The managers need to be able to trust reports of progress. The programmers need to be able to trust each other. Defects destroy this trust. Without trust, people spend much of their time defending themselves against the possibility that someone else may have made a mistake.

> The most powerful design heuristic I know is Once and Only Once: data, structure, or logic should exist in only one place in the system. I discover the need for design investment by spotting duplication.

> It doesn’t matter how brilliant and elegant a piece of design is; if the people who need to work with it don’t understand it, it isn’t simple for them.

> Duplication of logic or structure makes code hard to understand and modify.

> As so often happens in consulting, the client already knew the answer. Part of my job as a consultant is to find the person with the knowledge and convey that knowledge to the person with the power.

> Software development is full of the waste of overproduction: fat requirements documents that rapidly grow obsolete; elaborate architectures that are never used; code that goes months without being integrated, tested, and executed in a production environment; and documentation no one reads until it is irrelevant or misleading. While all of these activities are important to software development, we need to use their output immediately in order to get the feedback we need to eliminate waste.
