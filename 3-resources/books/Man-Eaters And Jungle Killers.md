# Man-Eaters And Jungle Killers
by [[Kenneth Anderson]]

## Highlights
> Those who have seen the marvel of an Indian jungle sunrise will never forget it.

> The signs of the jungle are very clear to those who can read them.

> The deep-hearted weeping of a strong and brave man is not pleasant to witness; it is infectious, and I felt a strange lump rising in my own throatâ€”a lump which refused to subside for quite a time.

> The brilliant moonlight bathed the jungle in its ethereal glow, making visible each leaf and grass-blade as they gracefully vibrated to the soft currents of the night-breezes that gently wafted the scent of night flowers along the glades of the forest, or blew in gusts between the aisles of its myriad trees.
