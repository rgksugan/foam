# Designing Data-Intensive Applications
by [[Martin Kleppmann]]

## Highlights
> The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a scale like that was so error-free?

> Many applications today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive. Raw CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for these applicationsâ€”bigger problems are usually the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing.

## Contents
### Part 1: Foundations of Data Systems
#### Reliable, Scalable & Maintainable Applications
* Mostly all applications are built with standard building blocks. These building blocks are
    * database
    * cache (to store the result of an expensive operation)
    * search index (search by keyword or filter)
    * stream processing (asynchronus messages)
    * batch processing (periodically crunch large data)
  * And these different blocks are stitched together through application code
* There are many factors that may influence the design of a data system
  * skills and experience of the people involved
  * legacy system dependencies
  * time scale for delivery
  * regulatory constraints
