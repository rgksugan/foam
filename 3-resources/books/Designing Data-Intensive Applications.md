# Designing Data-Intensive Applications
by [[Martin Kleppmann]]

## Highlights
> The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a scale like that was so error-free?

> Many applications today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive. Raw CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for these applicationsâ€”bigger problems are usually the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing.
