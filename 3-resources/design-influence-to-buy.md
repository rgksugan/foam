There’s a reason why staples like milk and eggs are in the back, ensuring you’ll travel up at least one aisle, past dozens of more profitable products for sale (it may be easier for the store to maintain, as well). The placement of every row, the nature of every special or sale and the position of each product on every shelf are thoughtful decisions trying to influence your behavior in ways you wouldn’t want if you were aware of them.
