# Sunrise and Sunsets

> The sunrises and sunsets are so extraordinarily beautiful that my body turns inside out and empties my heart into the sky.
> - Jupiter's Travels (Simon, Ted)

> Everyone who has eyes to see a sunset—and the number, as you might have observed, is regrettably few—thinks that the sunsets in his particular part of the world are the best ever.
> - The Man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag (Corbett, Jim)


I was born and bought up in a village near Kanyakumari. Kanyakumari is the southern most point in the mainland India. Kanyakumari is known for its beautiful Sunrise and Sunsets. And a lot of tourists flock there to view the sunrises and Sunsets. Despite of that I never enjoyed the sunrise and sunset in Kanyakumari. It is always crowded. One would only see a lot of heads in front of yourself and in all directions around you.
