# Science

I started reading late in life. I started reading only after college. For the first time, when I started reading Science, I fell in love with it. I did score well in Science subjects in school. It felt like I wasn't memorising and understanding things. But when I started reading Science later in life, it felt like it makes sense now.

Like most of my trips are inspired by books, this trip was also inspired the book [[How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming]] by [[Mike Brown]].
