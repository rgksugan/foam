# Coffee Can Investing: The Low Risk Road to Stupendous Wealth
by [[Saurabh Mukherjea]] [[Rakshit Ranjan]] [[Pranab Uniyal]]

## Highlights
> To begin with, of the approximately 5000 listed companies in India, we will limit our search to companies with a minimum market capitalization of Rs 100 crore, as the reliability of data on companies smaller than this is somewhat suspect. There are around 1500 listed companies in India with a market cap above Rs 100 crore. Then, we look for companies that over the preceding decade have grown sales each year by at least 10 per cent alongside generating Return on Capital Employed (pre-tax) of at least 15 per cent.

> However, our analysis above suggests that in the Indian stock market, a low P/E multiple-based investing approach does NOT improve the return profile of an investor.

> Apart from #death and #taxes, you can now add expenses as the only certainties in life!
