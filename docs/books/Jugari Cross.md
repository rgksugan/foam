# Jugari Cross
by [[K.P. Poornachandra Tejaswi]]

## Highlights and Notes
> His father realized that his son was a “Gone Case” after hearing that Suresh had picked literature as his major.

> The flowing river was the only indication of mobility in that colossal still universe.

> The whole [[Western Ghats]] gets lost during monsoons.  The clouds surrounding the Ghats hide these mountain ranges for the most part of the days during monsoon seasons.  Misty fog during the day limits the visibility to about two yards.
