# The Toilet Seat
by [[Latha.]]

## Highlights
> If you don’t laugh during #sex at least once, you are having sex with the wrong person.

> It takes more than #sex to build a great #marriage, but is it nearly impossible to build a great #marriage without it!

> If #sex isn’t an important part of your #marriage, you can’t beef if your wife or husband does this unimportant thing with somebody else every once in a while, if you have no interest in it.

> The subject of #sex has always been an intriguing one for me. I am sure it is so for many of us. Well, it is obvious because anything with a taboo attached to it creates interest in us. Anything that is forbidden and suppressed builds our curiosity and urges us to know more about it and experience more of it. Many people have written on sex. In fact, I have read a few books on the subject. These books either talk about the physical act of sex or they deal with sex in a physiological, philosophical or psychological manner. I would encourage you to first read the books of the latter kind, as it is not possible to enjoy lasting pleasure without understanding the depth of the emotions connected with sex.

> Many of them approach me under the pretext of ‘love’ though what they want is my acceptance to sleep with them. Some of them say that they do not enjoy sex with their wives, either because their wives are not interested in sex or they do not get along well with their wives. While I call the former people ‘hypocrites,’ the latter people clearly puzzle me. Are women supposed to take pity on these ‘deprived’ men and do a charitable deed for them?

> Very rarely do I come across men who tell me directly that they would like to have sex with me as that is what they want. Irrespective of whether I accept the invitation or not, I would certainly appreciate these men for their straightforwardness.

> It is a general notion that ‘good’ and ‘decent’ people do not talk about sex openly and only the ‘dirty’ people talk about sex.

> Most of the time, people misunderstand this. When we pour out our problems to others, they think that we expect them to sort out our issues. Not at all! Sometimes, we just want to share our feelings or problems at a particular point in time. We are not always looking for solutions from others.

> If sex is taught and talked about openly, we will definitely be able to reduce the number of rapes, molestation and bad touches and save our future generations from physical and mental torture. The openness can strengthen the relationship between sexual partners, make sex more enjoyable, and help healthier friendships blossom between people of the opposite sexes. Then sex will no longer be considered a ‘dirty’ word.

> While it is okay for men to talk about sex openly, women cannot. In fact, women do not take the liberty of talking about it openly. When they do decide to talk about it and come out in the open with their views and perceptions, society considers them immoral.

> People do not seem to understand the difference between talking about sex and sexy talk.

> I do not understand this hypocrisy. When I talk about food, I do not find a queue of men standing in front of my house with their plates, assuming that I am offering them food. However, when I talk about sex, they (they do not think or assume) decide that I am inviting them to sleep with me.

> Our society also assumes that women do not approach men for sex. This is also one of the reasons for a man to keep thrusting his wish to have sex with her even after her clear NO. When asked why, the answer is very simple. Which woman will say YES the first time itself even if she wants to?

> Even if she is willing to have sex with people she likes, why should anyone assume that she would be willing to sleep with anyone and everyone who approaches her? And why should a man’s ego get hit when a woman turns his request down? What does #love, sex or physical attraction mean to these people? And what do people try to achieve by forcing someone to have sex with them?

> We unwittingly ingrain the belief that a woman’s core objective in life is to appear beautiful to others.

> As the girl steps into adolescence, her focus is only on beautifying herself, without which she does not feel confident about herself. She believes that only beautiful girls attract good-looking and smart men.

> His response clearly puzzled me. Can objectifying a woman’s body part be seen as a joke? Every day, we come across derogatory remarks and actions by people around us. They act or say things in a very casual, matter-of-fact manner. The jokes that are forwarded in WhatsApp and the messages posted on Facebook are received without anyone raising a brow or batting an eyelid. When I object to such jokes, people wonder what is wrong with me.

> In my opinion, #masturbation is a much better indulgence than loveless #sex.

> As soon as a child attains puberty (there is scientific proof that even a male child attains puberty at a certain age and has a menstruation cycle, just like a woman, though it is not obvious), the sexual energy automatically starts flowing within.

> Many marriages are ruined on day one itself because of ignorance, though the partners carry on living together just for the sake of society, because they think that is how marriage is supposed to be and everyone must be going through the same problem.

> How many schools, colleges or even homes for that matter impart the lessons of life to their children? How many elders have asked the so-called ‘eligible’ bachelor if he is indeed eligible for marriage? Eligibility in our society only means the money a man brings into the family. When it comes to a woman, even that is not mandatory.

> How many men and women are clear about the responsibilities they have to take up when they take in another life into their lives? Do we ever teach youngsters how to nurture the newly found relationship in their lives? The answer is a big NO! Have any of us advised youngsters to read a good book on sex before getting married? Do we gift couples an educative book on sex so that they become responsible husbands and wives? When one of the underlying reasons for marriage is safe sex, why are we so hesitant to talk and learn about it? Why do we not think sex requires proper education and learning?

> How many people are able to make the other person feel loved and respected when they share their bodies with each other?

> In many cases, the man is active, and the woman settles for being a passive partner. Depending on her personality, the woman either uses #sex to her advantage or cries silently within herself when she is forced into a corner.

> Also, love is expressed more through touch rather than the words we speak. When this need is not taken care of properly, there is every chance that the love may start diminishing.
