# Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track
by [[Will Larson]] and [[Tanya Reilly]]

## Highlights and Notes
> You’re far more likely to change your company’s long-term trajectory by growing the engineers around you than through personal heroics. The best way to grow those around you is by creating an active practice of mentorship and sponsorship.

> Work on what matters to make the most of the working hours you have, particularly as you get further along in your career and life’s commitments expand.

> If you’re continuing to advance in your career, then even as your time available for work shrinks, the expectations around your impact will keep growing.

> Companies operate in an eternal iterative elimination tournament, balancing future success against surviving until that future becomes the present.

> We only get value from finishing projects, and getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes from risk to leverage. Time spent getting work finished is always time well spent.

> Whether a given project requires a design document comes down to personal judgment, but I’ve found a few rules useful. You should write design documents for any project whose capabilities will be used by numerous future projects. You should also write design documents for projects that meaningfully impact your users. You should write a design document for any work taking more than a month of engineering time.

> As an engineering leadership team, your goal is to maintain an appropriate technical quality level while devoting as much energy as possible towards the core business. You must balance quality across multiple timeframes, and those timeframes generally have conflicting needs.

> Process rollout requires humans to change how they work, which you shouldn’t undertake lightly.

> Remember, attention is a scarce resource! If you waste folks’ time with a nudge email or ping, they won’t pay attention to the next one.

> Retire your remaining expectations that the company is designed to set you up for success. Now you are one of the people responsible for setting the company, your team, and your manager up for success.

> What you can accomplish alone is far from what you can accomplish by creating leaders.

> The two most effective ways to deal with jerks are: including someone they can’t be a jerk to in the meeting (like their #manager or the CTO) investing heavily into aligning with them before the meeting, so they feel heard and are less likely to derail the discussion

> Separate style from substance, and stop giving style feedback on other folks’ decisions. If a piece of feedback won’t meaningfully change a project’s success, then consider not giving it. If it’s useful but not critical, potentially make a private suggestion rather than pulling a meeting into your orbit

> The only way to remain a long-term leader of a genuinely successful company is to continually create space for others to take the recognition, reward, and work that got you to where you’re currently sitting. It can be surprisingly uncomfortable, but don’t worry: there will always be new work for you anyway.

> The foundation of communicating effectively with executives is to get a clear understanding of why you’re communicating with them in the first place. You might be used to communicating with folks to change their mind or inform them about your project, but that’s probably not the case here. When you’re communicating with an executive, it’s almost always one of three things: planning, reporting on status, or resolving misalignment.
